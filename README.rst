LIkelihood Ratio Interpretation of Clinical AbnormaLities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LIRICAL is designed to provide clincially interpretable computational analysis of phenotypic
abnormalities (encoded using the `Human Phenotype Ontology <http://www.human-phenotyope-ontology.org>`_),
optionally combined with an analysis of variants and genotypes if a VCF file is provided with the
results of diagnostic gene panel, exome, or genome sequencing.


Please consult the Read the docs site for `Detailed documentation <https://lirical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
