comment: Note that some of the terms, such as Intellectual disability, have children terms such as Severe intellectual disability that represent precomposed combinations of modifiers and phenotypic abnormality terms. This done where the medical community commonly uses these terms with a fixed meaning (for instance, the Intellectual disability terms are used with specific IQ ranges). For computational reasoning, the semantics are intended to be the same as if there was a combination of the phenotype term and the clinical modifier term.

def: "A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age." [DDD:hvfirth, HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
