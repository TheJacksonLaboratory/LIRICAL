# LIRICAL


## LIkelihood Ratio Interpretation of Clinical AbnormaLities

LIRICAL is designed to provide clincially interpretable computational analysis of phenotypic
abnormalities (encoded using the [Human Phenotype Ontology](http://www.human-phenotyope-ontology.org),
optionally combined with an analysis of variants and genotypes if a VCF file is provided with the
results of diagnostic gene panel, exome, or genome sequencing.

A manuscript describing LIRICAL is available at the 
[American Journal of Human Genetics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32755546/).


Please consult the Read the docs site for [Detailed documentation](https://lirical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
