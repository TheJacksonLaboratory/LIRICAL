Likelihood ratio analysis of phenotypes and genotypes


## Likelihood Ratio Analysis of Phenotype/Genotype Data for Genomic Diagnostics

TODO-- finish this README.

For now please see the read the docs in the docs/ subdirectory!

## How to generate the documentation


cd to the docs directory. Somehow, get to a sane python installation. Install both
sphinx and ``sphinx_rtd_theme``. Then make the HTML pages. For instance, assuming you have used
Anaconda to create a Python3 environment called ``p3``, ::

```
$ conda activate p3
$ pip install sphinx
$ pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
$ make html
```
