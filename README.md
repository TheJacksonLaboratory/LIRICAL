# LIRICAL
LIRICAL (LIkelihood Ratio Interpretation of Clinical AbnormaLities) 
is designed to provide clinically interpretable computational analysis of phenotypic
abnormalities (encoded using the [Human Phenotype Ontology](http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org)),
optionally combined with an analysis of variants and genotypes if a VCF file is provided with the
results of diagnostic gene panel, exome, or genome sequencing.

A manuscript describing LIRICAL is available at the 
[American Journal of Human Genetics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32755546/).
