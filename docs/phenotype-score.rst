LIRICAL's Phenotype Score
=========================

LIRICAL calculates a likelihood ratio score for phenotypic observations for each differential diagnosis. The phenotype
likelihood ratio score can be combined with LIRICAL's genotype likelhood ratio score for a combined analysis of
phenotypes and genetic data (such as exome or genome sequencing) or can be used as a tool to assess phenotype data
alone.


This page explains how to interpret LIRICAL's phenotype score.
