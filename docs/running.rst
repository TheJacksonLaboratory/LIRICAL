Running LR2PG
=============

Use either the YAML or the phenopacket method to pass G2GIT the necessary parameters and run it as described.

Depending on you computer, LR2PG will run from about 15 to 60 seconds, or longer if a whole-genome file is used
as input. This document will explain the HTML output as well as the format of the TSV output.


TODO -- wait until more dust has settled to write this.
