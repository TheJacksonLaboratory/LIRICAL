LIRICAL Output
==============

LIRICAL accepts phenopackets or YAML files as input (see :ref:`rstrunning`). In either case, LIRICAL
can output either an HTML file with a detailed summary of its analysis results, or a a
tab-separated value (TSV)  file that can be used by bioinformatic
pipelines. On typical computers, LIRICAL will run from about 15 to 60 seconds, or
longer if a whole-genome file is used
as input.
